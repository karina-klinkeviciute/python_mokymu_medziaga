Object oriented programming, OOP for short is one of the paradigms in programming. 

Object oriented programming uses classes. 

A class is a structure which holds data and also has methods for manipulation of this data. 

Example of a class:

```pytohn
Animal:
  def__init__(name, legs, can_swim, can_fly):
    self.name = name
    self.legs = legs
    self.can_swim = can_swim
    self.can_fly = can_fly
